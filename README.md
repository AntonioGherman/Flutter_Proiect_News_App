A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

An app that displays specific news headlines along with basic news information.

The news can be accessed on the respective web pages. You can search for a certain news by a keyword.

The news is obtained by calling the API https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?tags=front_page.
